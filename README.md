### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently in an internship program in technology, growing and learning so much. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and Node.JS. Step by step, everyday!

âš¡ A little more about me: It's my first time here, I'm on a carreer transition from a very different area and recently got a internship in technology. My goals involves to learning a lot to grow and be good enough with my skills, then find a very good job where I can work with something that I'll love to do everyday, and at the same time, being financially well to live the life I want. That's what motivates me and I'll work a lot to make this come true.
